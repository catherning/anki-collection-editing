# Fonctionalities

## Use cases
- I use the Extra field as a hint, showing a list of similar answers to other cards. But it's a hint only for some fields, it contains the answer for other fields. But in a cloze note, we can't chose if we want to show the Extra field for specific cloze fields, not all of them. Furthermore, I have sevaral cloze notes who follow the same patterns. So I transform the Cloze cards into basic cards where I can adapt the card templates : for some cards, I show the Extra field in the question, for others, in the Answer.

# Installation


# TODOs
- Handle the repetition of cloze field number (several {{c1:...}})
- Allow for mistakes => undo or else ?
